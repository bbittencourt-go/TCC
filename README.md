TCC - Estudando autômatos celulares com a linguagem de programação Go

TCC - Studying cellular automata using the Go programming language

Please read this in its entirety to avoid confusion.

This repository includes:
- Code for simulations of cellular automata (Game of Life, SmoothLife, Lenia) in Go language
- Results: videos generated after running said simulations
- Plot files (in plt folder) to generate .png files (of the whole grid for every generation) and .pdf files (population density graphs)

Details:
- No external libraries used (all libraries used are built-in)
- Manual convolution (where applicable, written as a function)

Instructions:
- You can run these simulations if Go is installed on your computer. If not, install Go at https://go.dev/.
- Download the simulations (.go files). You may need to move the files after download to go/src on your computer.
- Open the terminal (Windows cmd, Cygwin, etc.), move to the directory where the simulations are, and type in "go run simulation-name.go"
- Each simulation will produce a finite amount of .dat files (specified in the code as the constant NG, number of generations). These .dat files contain the entire grid, with each number representing the current state of the cell at the specified position.
- To generate images of the grid, you will need Gnuplot. Ensure it is on your computer or download it at http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html.
- Download and edit the grid.plt file to your specifications (number of generations, grid size, file name, etc.). Ensure it is in the same directory as the .dat files and run it by clicking on it.
      - The grid.plt file contains a rainbow color palette to plot SmoothLife and Lenia simulations. To plot Conway's Game of Life, you may want to adjust it.
- The same process can be done using the pop-density.plt file and the population density .dat file generated by the simulation. In this case, one .pdf graph can display many data files at once, so make adjustments to the file according to your intention.
- To make videos, open the terminal after generating all images, to be in the same directory. Then, copy and paste the following command, replacing "image-%d.png" and "video.mp4" as necessary:

ffmpeg -r 7 -i image-%d.png -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -y video.mp4

- Parameters may be edited in the .go files, and functions (kernel core and growth mapping) in Lenia's case. Said parameters are generally presented as constants, variables, or equations, making them easy to alter. The initial condition utilized in GoL (pseudorandom state distribution) differs from the one used in both SmoothLife and Lenia (random squares) and may also be modified.
